# git-auto-commit-action

This GitHub Action automatically commits files which have been changed during a Workflow run and pushes the Commit back to GitHub.
Deafault Committer is "GitHub Actions <actions@github.com>" and the Author of the Commit is "Your GitHub Username <github_username@users.noreply.github.com>.

If no changes are available, the Actions does nothing.

This Action has been inspired and adapted from the [auto-commit](https://github.com/cds-snc/github-actions/tree/master/auto-commit
)-Action of the Canadian Digital Service and the [commit](https://github.com/elstudio/actions-js-build/blob/41d604d6e73d632e22eac40df8cc69b5added04b/commit/entrypoint.sh)-Action by Eric Johnson.

## Usage

Add the following step at the end of your job.

```yaml
- uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v2.4.0
  with:
    commit_message: Apply automatic changes
    branch: ${{ github.head_ref }}
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

    # Optional Github Login
    github_login: ${{ github.actor }}

    # Optional git params
    commit_options: '--no-verify --signoff'

    #Â Optional glob pattern of files which should be added to the commit
    file_pattern: src/\*.js

    # Optional repository path
    repository: .

    # Optional committer info
    commit_author_name: "Ivan Ivanov"
    commit_author_email: "ivanov@example.com"
```

You **do not** have to create a new secret called `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your repository. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is a special token GitHub creates automatically during an Action run. (See [the documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) for details)

The Action will only commit files back, if changes are available. The resulting commit **will not trigger** another GitHub Actions Workflow run!

It is recommended to use this Action in Workflows which listen to the `pull_request` event. If you want to use the Action on other events, you have to hardcode the value for `branch` as `github.head_ref` is only available in Pull Requests.

## Example Usage

This Action will only work, if the job in your workflow changes project files.
The most common use case for this, is when you're running a Linter or Code-Style fixer on GitHub Actions.

In this example I'm running `php-cs-fixer` in a PHP project.


```yaml
name: php-cs-fixer

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
    - '**.php'

jobs:
  php-cs-fixer:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      with:
        fetch-depth: 1

    - name: Run php-cs-fixer
      uses: docker://oskarstark/php-cs-fixer-ga

    - name: Commit changed files
      uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v2.4.0
      with:
        commit_message: Apply php-cs-fixer changes
        branch: ${{ github.head_ref }}
        file_pattern: src/\*.php
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

```
